    About Me:
    I'm a self-taught web developer with a strong foundation in frontend (HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript, React) and backend (Python, Flask, SQLite). I completed Harvard's CS50x and the Scrimba Frontend Career Path, and have built several responsive web applications focused on clean code, smooth UX, and modern design.
    Key Projects:
    Quizzical :  Quizzical is a trivia quiz app built with React. It fetches
        multiple-choice questions from the Open Trivia Database API and
        challenges users to test their knowledge in a fun and interactive way.
        Features include randomized answers, score tracking, and dynamic
        question loading â€” all wrapped in a responsive and minimalist design.
    tenzies : A fun, interactive game where you roll dice to get all the same number. Built with React.
    Budgeting-app: Budgeting App is a single-page application built with React and Vite that allows users to track their income and expenses. It features dynamic routing using React Router, and a simple UI for adding, viewing, and managing transactions. The app maintains state using React hooks and is designed for local use.
    Portfolio Website: A professional developer portfolio with theme toggle, and responsive design, everything you need to know about
    Other Frontend Projects: Include interactive components and responsive layouts built with React and Tailwind CSS.
    Work Ethic:
    Driven, detail-oriented, and constantly learning. I love building useful tools and working on meaningful problems. Currently looking for remote opportunities to grow, contribute, and collaborate in real-world environments.
