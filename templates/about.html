    <p class="text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary mb-4">
      I'm a self-taught developer who transitioned into tech through hands-on
      learning. After completing courses like CS50x and Scrimba's Frontend
      Career Path, I’ve built real projects using modern tools like Flask,
      React, and Tailwind.
    </p>
    <p class="text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary">
      My goal is to join a passionate team where I can grow as a developer,
      contribute to real-world solutions, and keep learning every day. When I’m
      not coding, I’m probably tweaking my portfolio or learning new frameworks.
